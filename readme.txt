--Readme document for MAIELLA NUQUI, mnuqui@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

    - Icon library integration:
        - Font Awesome icons throughout all pages
    - Responsive design:
        -Breakpoints for different screen sizes
    - Semanting HTML structure for accessibility
    

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
    Some accessibility errors that were igonered included the following:
    1. Color Contrast Issues:
        - The pink accent color (#ffb6c1) was chosen for brand consistency and aesthetic appeal
        - While it may not meet WCAG AA standards in all cases, it was deemed acceptable for a portfolio website
        - Important text uses darker colors for better contrast

    2. Missing Video Captions:
        - The prototype videos are demonstrations of UI/UX work
        - They are supplementary content, not primary information
        - Adding captions would require significant additional time and resources

    3. Decorative Icons:
        - Some Font Awesome icons are used for visual enhancement
        - They are paired with text labels for clarity
        - Screen readers can still access the text content


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    The estimated time breakdown for the project was approximately 14–16 hours in total. Since I already had my content gathered beforehand from a previous portfolio, most of the effort focused on designing the layout, implementing styling, and refining advanced features. 
    The planning and design phase took around 2 hours, which included layout planning, finalizing the color scheme and typography. HTML development required about 3–4 hours to build the structure for four pages, implement semantic HTML, and integrate the prepared content and images. 
    CSS styling took approximately 4–5 hours, focusing on custom CSS development, Bootstrap integration and customization, responsive design, and hover effects. Advanced features such as video integration, complex layouts, and icon usage took about 3 hours. 
    Finally, testing and refinement took around 2 hours, including responsive, accessibility review, and W3C validation.
